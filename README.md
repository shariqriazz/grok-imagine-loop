# Grok Imagine Loop Extension

A Chrome Utility Extension to automate video generation loops on [Grok.com](https://grok.com).

This tool allows you to create seamless video sequences by automatically using the last frame of a generated video as the input for the next generation, creating a continuous "flow" effect.

## Features

*   **🔄 Auto-Looping (Scenes):** Automatically chains video generations. Define how many "Scenes" you want for your story.
*   **🖼️ Smart Frame Extraction:** Extracts the last frame of a video to use as the start of the next one.
*   **⚡ Upscale Support:** Check "Upscale Result" to automatically request the High Quality version of each video.
*   **📥 Auto-Download:** Automatically saves each generated segment to your Downloads folder.
*   **💾 State Persistence:**
    *   **Input Saving:** Your Prompts, Scene counts, and settings are saved automatically.
    *   **Image Resume:** If you close the popup, your uploaded initial image is restored (`✓ my-image.jpg`).
    *   **Crash Recovery:** Safely reload your browser; your progress is saved and can be resumed.
*   **⇱ Power User UI:**
    *   **Pop Out Mode:** Detach the controller into a separate window to keep it visible while you work.
    *   **Modern Dark Mode:** Sleek interface that matches the Grok aesthetic.
*   **🛡️ Anti-Bot Protection:** Human-like typing, clicking, and randomized delays to avoid detection.
*   **🛠️ Smart Recovery:** Options to regenerate single segments or cascade changes to all future segments.
